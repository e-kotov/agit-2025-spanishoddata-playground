------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Setup

Before getting the data, make sure you have `{spanishoddata}` R package installed and loaded. We will also need `{tidyverse}` and `{sf}`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("spanishoddata", "tidyverse", "sf"))
```

```{r}
library(spanishoddata)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```


The package needs a dedicated location on disk to save the data it downloads. Set it with:

```{r}
spod_set_data_dir("data")
```

The folder will be created if it does not exist.

```
Data directory /path/to/your/working/dir/data does not exist. Attempting to create it.
Data directory is writeable.
Data directory successfully set to: /path/to/your/working/dir/data
```

Here we are just setting the data directory to a subdirectory called `data` in the current working directory. If you want to use a different directory, change the path to something like `spod_set_data_dir("C:/path/to/data")` on `Windows` or `spod_set_data_dir("/path/to/data")` on `Linux`/`macOS`.

::: {.callout-warning}
If you do not set the data directory, the package will still work, but it will download the data  into a termporary directory of the current `R` session and you will lose it if you restart the session.
:::

Now you are all set to start accessing the data!

# Get the data

The data consists of zone boundaries spatial data and flat tables with flows between the zones. There are more details in the codebooks on the package website  ([codebook for v1 data covering years 2020-2021](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/articles/v1-2020-2021-mitma-data-codebook.html), [codebook for v2 data covering years 2022 onwards](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/articles/v2-2022-onwards-mitma-data-codebook.html)).

::: {.callout-note}
We will be working with v2 data, as it is more advanced and contains more variables.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
v1 and v2 data are not directly comparable in terms of absolute number of trips between locations, as the methodologies for data colleciton and generation are slightly different.
:::

## Get the zone boundaries data

```{r}
zones <- spod_get_zones(zones = "districts", ver = 2)
```

```{r}
glimpse(zones)
```

## Get the flows data

### Define the dates

Let us get a few days of data. We will investigate the days when the city of Valencia [was flooded](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/30/in-pictures-devastating-flash-floods-hit-spains-eastern-and-southern-regions).

We can get all dates that are available in the data:

```{r}
available_dates <- spod_get_valid_dates(ver = 2)
```

And check if the [dates of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Spanish_floods#In_the_Valencian_Community) exist in the available data range:

```{r}
dates <- seq(ymd("2024-10-27"), ymd("2024-11-02"), by = "day")
all(dates %in% available_dates)
```

```r
TRUE
```

We can also check if the data is available for the weeks before and after the flood:

```{r}
dates <- seq(ymd("2024-10-20"), ymd("2024-11-09"), by = "day")
all(dates %in% available_dates)
```

```r
FALSE
```

One date is missing:

```{r}
dates[which(!dates %in% available_dates)]
```

```r
"2024-11-09"
```


::: {.callout-warning}

Due to mobile network outages, the data on certain dates is missing. Kindly keep this in mind when calculating mean monthly or weekly flows.

Please check the [original data page](https://www.transportes.gob.es/ministerio/proyectos-singulares/estudios-de-movilidad-con-big-data/opendata-movilidad){target="_blank"} for currently known missing dates. You can use `spod_get_valid_dates()` function to get all available dates as shown above.
:::

But that is fine, we still have the data for several days before and after.

### Define the type of data and spatial scale

The Spanish mobility data [@mitms_mobility_web] contains several different datasets with different spatial scales and types of data, such as overnight stays, resident population counts and more. We will focus on origin-destination flows data for the most detailed spatial resolution.

Let us get the origin-destination flows for:

- a day on the week before the flood

- a day immidiately after the flood

- a day of the week following the flood

- a day one month after the flood

```{r}
dates <- c("2024-10-23", "2024-10-30", "2024-11-06", "2024-11-27")
all(dates %in% available_dates)
```

```r
TRUE
```

### Get the data

The code below will download the requested dates and create the `flows` table.

```{r}
flows <- spod_get(
  type = "origin-destination",
  zones = "districts",
  dates = dates
)
```

::: {.callout-note}
For the 4 requested dates, the `spod_get()` call above will download just under 1 GB of data. If you need to download more days, you will have to set the `max_download_size_gb` argument in `spod_get()`. This is a precaution against downloading too much data at once.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
`spod_download()` can be used with the same arguments to simply pre-download the data without setting it up as a table.
:::

You can now print the table to preview it:

```{r}
flows
```

Or use `glimpse()` to view its structure:

```{r}

```

::: {.callout-tip}
`str()` and `summary()` will not work on this data in a way that you might expect, as it is not an ordinary `data.frame`, but a special `tbl_*` table object that is actually powered by [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/) via [`{duckdb}`](https://r.duckdb.org/) R package in the background, but pretends to be a `tibble` (from [`{tibble}`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)/[`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)/[`{tidyverse}`](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)).

```{r}

::: {.callout-tip}
The meaning of all the variables is explained in the [codebook](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/articles/v2-2022-onwards-mitma-data-codebook.html#od-data).
:::


::: {.callout-tip}
If for your analysis, only need total daily flows between municipalties without any extra information, you can save time by getting pre-aggregated reduced size data directly from the [interactive map hosted by the Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility](https://mapas-movilidad.transportes.gob.es/). To do this, kindly refer to the ["Quicky get daily data" vignette](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/articles/quick-get.html). However, this is not recommended for studies that require the code to be reproducible, as the API may change at any time. You can use this functionality for quick mobility estimates and in classroom for experiments.
:::




### Data verification

When mobility data files are downloaded with `spod_get()` or `spod_download()`, they are automatically checked by file size against known size of the remote files to prevent currupted downloads and preserve data integrity. However, if you would like to do an extra check you can use `spod_check_files()` with the same arguments you used for `spod_get()` or `spod_download()`.


```{r}
file_check <- spod_check_files(
  type = "origin-destination",
  zones = "districts",
  dates = dates
)
```

```
Data version detected from dates: 2
Using existing disk cache: /path/to/your/working/dir/data/metadata_cache/metadata_s3_v2_2025-07-02.rds
All checked files are consistent.
```


```{r}
all(file_check$local_file_consistent)
```

```r
TRUE
```

If the some files were corrupted, you could easily find out which ones with:

```{r}
file_check |>
  filter(local_file_consistent == FALSE)
```

And you would be able to fix this by simply re-running the call to `spod_get()` or `spod_download()`.

# Aggregate the data

As noted before, the table you get from `spod_get()` is not an ordinary R `data.frame` or `tibble`. It is a database connection. As a result, you are actually supposed to query it using [SQL syntax of DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/introduction.html#querying-a-table){target="_blank"}. However, thanks to the comprehensive ecosystem of R packages, for most operations, you can get away with using [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) funtions and many other [`{tidyverse}`](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) and base R tools, as if this was just a `data.frame` or `tibble` table.

::: {.callout-warning}
Not all analytical and data processing capabilities of `DuckDB` are available via base R and `tidyverse` functions, in some cases you will have to resort to `SQL` language. Large language models are of great help with that, do not hesistate to paste the description of the table from `glimpse(trips)` and your query into your favourite LLM to get the `SQL` query.

You can send an [DuckDB SQL query](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/introduction.html#querying-a-table){target="_blank"} and get the result as shown below:
```{r}
con <- dbplyr::remote_con(flows) # get the underlying database connection
table_name <- dbplyr::remote_name(flows) # get the table name
library(duckdb)
library(glue)
dbGetQuery(con, glue("SELECT * FROM {table_name} LIMIT 5")) # simple example of SQL query, but can be any query supported by DuckDB
```

:::

Many common data operations are supported, such as `{dplyr}`'s [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html), [`select()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html), [`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html), [`summarise()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html), [`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) and more, as well as [`{lubridate}`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) data and time manipulation functions, and base R `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, etc.

## Aggregation examples

### Count the total number of over all days

```{r}
flows |>
  summarise(
    n_trips = sum(n_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  collect()
```

```r
# A tibble: 1 × 1    
     n_trips
       <dbl>
1 591212295.
```

### Count total number of trips per day

```{r}
flows |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(
    n_trips = sum(n_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  collect()
```


```r
# A tibble: 4 × 2    
  date          n_trips
  <date>          <dbl>
1 2024-10-23 148427847.
2 2024-11-27 148479109.
3 2024-11-06 149441508.
4 2024-10-30 144863831.
```


### Count total number of work trips in the morning hours by women vs men

```{r}
m_vs_f_morning_commute <- flows |>
  filter(!is.na(sex), hour %in% 6:10) |>
  group_by(date, sex) |>
  summarise(
    n_trips = sum(n_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(date, sex) |>
  collect()

m_vs_f_morning_commute
```

```r
# A tibble: 8 × 3
  date       sex      n_trips
  <date>     <fct>      <dbl>
1 2024-10-23 female 11481768.
2 2024-10-23 male   10736460.
3 2024-10-30 female 11335501.
4 2024-10-30 male   10596445.
5 2024-11-06 female 11458701.
6 2024-11-06 male   10719684.
7 2024-11-27 female 11488244.
8 2024-11-27 male   10740725.
```


Plot it

```{r}
m_vs_f_morning_commute_plot <- m_vs_f_morning_commute |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n_trips, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
#| include: false

  dpi = 200,
  create.dir = TRUE
)
```

# Slow aggregation? Convert the data to analysis-ready format

The aggregations above may take 30-60 seconds to complete. To make the analysis faster even on these few dates, convert the data to an analysis-ready format. By default it is DuckDB. All you need to do is to replace the `spod_get()` call with `spod_convert()` call, and then connect to the database with `spod_connect()`. The conversion for these few days we are working with will take just a minute or two.

::: {.callout-tip}
You can read more about the conversion and different formats in the [conversion vignette](https://ropenspain.github.io/spanishoddata/articles/convert.html). You can find the up to date speed test comparison of formats using mobility data in [https://github.com/e-kotov/spanishoddata-paper-supplement/blob/main/plots/supplement-plots/12_analysis-speed.pdf](https://github.com/e-kotov/spanishoddata-paper-supplement/blob/main/plots/supplement-plots/12_analysis-speed.pdf){target="_blank"}.

Now try the same aggregations as above, but on the `flows_db` object. They should be much faster now, alsmost instant.

```{r}
flows_db |>
  summarise(
    n_trips = sum(n_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  collect()
```

```{r}
flows_db |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(
    n_trips = sum(n_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  collect()
```
